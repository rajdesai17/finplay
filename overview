### 🛠️ CORE FUNCTIONALITY CHECKLIST

Ensure all core flows are working smoothly across all modules:

#### 1. 🧑‍🎓 Youth Mode

* [ ] Simulations work: budgeting, UPI fraud, tax filing, side hustle, EMI, savings
* [ ] Every simulation starts, processes choices, shows result or score
* [ ] Navigation between modules is smooth
* [ ] UPI fraud and Credit Score games trigger interactive choices
* [ ] No simulation causes crash, loop, or dead end

#### 2. 🧒 Kids Mode

* [ ] Games like Piggy Bank, Barter Game, Spot the Scam are working
* [ ] Visuals are kid-friendly, colorful, fun
* [ ] Instructions are clear and readable
* [ ] Sounds and animations (if any) are playful, not noisy
* [ ] Easy switch back to youth mode

#### 3. 🏆 Rewards & Progress (Prototype-only)

* [ ] Simulated reward animations for badges, unlockables, cashback
* [ ] Placeholder for wallet integration (UPI rewards etc.)
* [ ] Leaderboard or progress indicators (fake/mock OK)

#### 4. 📱 Device Compatibility

* [ ] Fully responsive on:

  * Mobile (esp. ₹6K Androids, 360px width)
  * Tablet view
  * Desktop browsers
* [ ] Offline-lite mode tested (cache/indexedDB or static fallback)

---

### 🎨 UI/UX POLISH (Light Theme Based)

* [ ] Clean grid or light-patterned background
* [ ] Typography is playful yet readable
* [ ] Spacing and margins are consistent
* [ ] Buttons use subtle shadow + hover effects
* [ ] CTAs pop clearly but don’t distract
* [ ] Pages have subtle entrance animations (fade, slide-in)

---

### 📈 EXPANSION REQUESTS

Please expand the app **without breaking core prototype**. Assume mock/static data where needed.

#### 1. 🧠 Add a **Career Quiz**

* 3–5 fun questions to map a user to suggested career paths
* Show result + recommended financial simulations (e.g. freelancer → invoice, tax game)

#### 2. 🎓 Add a **Mini Finance Glossary**

* Add a new section: “Learn the Lingo”
* Include 15–20 terms (e.g. FD, SIP, EMI, Credit Score, Tax Slab)
* Each term opens a card with a short, simple explanation

#### 3. 📜 Add “My Finance Report Card” mock

* After completing 3+ games, show a fake report card:

  * Name: “You”
  * Level: Budget Rookie, Fraud Buster, Tax Champ etc.
  * Progress bar + tips

#### 4. 🔊 Add Basic Sound FX (optional)

* Coin jingle, error buzz, success chime — use sparingly
